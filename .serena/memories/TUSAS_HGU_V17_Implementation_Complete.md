# TUSAŞ HGU V17 Implementation - Final Summary

## ✅ Complete System Architecture Transformation

Successfully completed comprehensive TIA Portal V17-compliant restructure of TUSAŞ HGU hydraulic control system:

### Core Achievements
- **Load Sensing Logic**: Rising trigger system setpoint coordination implemented
- **V17 Compliance**: Full Instance Data Block architecture with proper FB structure
- **PUMP/MOTOR/VALVE Naming**: Clear separation of hydraulic, electrical, and valve controls
- **PID Control**: OB30 cyclic interrupt (200ms) with PID_Compact V2.2 controllers
- **System Coordination**: OB1 main program with proper FB instance calls

### Architecture Components
1. **DB_HGU_Execution_V17.scl** - Main data structure with PUMP naming convention
2. **OB30_PID_Control.scl** - Cyclic interrupt for 6x PID controllers
3. **Main_OB1_V17.scl** - V17-compliant main program
4. **4x Instance DBs** - FB instances for proper V17 architecture

### Technical Details
- **6x75kW Load Sensing Pumps**: Individual pressure/flow control with system coordination
- **Rising Trigger Logic**: System setpoint changes propagate to all active pumps
- **Check Valve Protection**: Manifold architecture with individual pump control
- **V17 Restrictions**: Proper separation of OB/FB/DB with Instance Data Blocks
- **PID Integration**: Professional PID_Compact controllers in OB30 cyclic interrupt

### File Management
- **Proper Directory Structure**: All SCL files in correct TIA Portal folders
- **Cleanup Completed**: Removed duplicates and obsolete files (12 files deleted)
- **Backup Strategy**: Original files preserved before transformation

## Status: IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE ✅
All 12 tasks completed successfully. System ready for TIA Portal V17 compilation and testing.
